#  🧱Examining the History of Lego Sets

## 🚀 About the Project

This project analyzes the history of Lego sets using data-driven methods. By exploring different Lego sets released over the years, we aim to uncover patterns and trends in their themes, piece counts, and popularity.

### Key Objectives:
- Cleaning and processing Lego dataset.
- Analyzing trends in Lego set releases.
- Identifying changes in themes and piece counts over time.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Pandas** → Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Jupyter Notebook** → Data analysis and documentation.

## 📈 Data Analysis Tasks
The team responsible for the Star Wars partnership has asked for specific information in preparation for their meeting:

1. What percentage of all licensed sets ever released were Star Wars themed? Save your answer as a variable the_force, as an integer (e.g. 25).

2. In which year was the highest number of Star Wars sets released? Save your answer as a variable new_era, as an integer (e.g. 2012).
